# RC-Metal-Detector-Robot
Designed and built a remote-controlled robot featuring an RF transmitter for wireless communication, a joystick-controlled drive system using PWM and an H-bridge for speed and direction control, and a custom inductor-based metal detector that varies frequency with coin proximity.

-the robot base code contains the code flashed on the mcu on the actual robot itself, while the other file contains the code flashed onto the RF remote.
